# Project 2 - Fun with Filters and Frequencies!

## All code lies inside main.py (ipynb)

## Source images lie in the data typically and output contains nearly all the result images.

### All images no matter the sources or the results have been rescale to fit the website visualization. Therefore, if using the source images to run the code, the result may be different. If you want to reproduce the same result, you need to use the images with "_raw" in the name.
